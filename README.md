## Background

This project is a work in progress that has grown over time stemming from a need for a one stop shop solution for the evaluation of clinical prediction models for those who are either not interested or skilled in (advanced) programming. A host of performance measures are computed that cover

-   overall model performance
-   discrimination ability of the model
-   calibration ability of the model

At present, only binary outcomes are considered for when (i) data are complete - see "R_code_complete_data" folder for the necessary files and (ii) when data are incomplete, following multiple imputation - see "R_code_mi_data" folder for the necessary files. Both folders contains README files that provide details that are (hopefully) useful for using the functions.
